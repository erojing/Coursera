# Getting Started with your Lab Sandbox
VSCode Sandbox comes with mysql server and client for you to practice the SQL Basic commands.

## What extensions are already installed in this environment?
You can click on the extensions icon on the left panel of VSCode to see what extensions come with the sandbox instance. However, you will not need any of the extension for this course. 

## Getting Started with SQL in this Sandbox
All the assignments are based on the **Chinook** database. The link provided in the course is now out of date, but the same database has been provided for you to use in the /home/coder/project folder. You can open the **Chinook_MySql.sql** file and click on the play button to create the database or from the top menu, choose `Terminal` and then choose `New Terminal`.  When the terminal opens, type `mysql< Chinook_MySql.sql` to create the Chinook database with all the tables and data required for the assignments. Then type `mysql` to get into the mysql prompt and `use Chinook` to start your practice. 

## How does this Sandbox differ from Code Blocks in this course?
The code blocks included in the ungraded and graded quizzes have a database pre-loaded. We recommend sticking to the Code Blocks for all activites that include them, but you can use the Sandbox to practice your SQL or follow along with the course lectures.

## How can I exit my Terminal?
To exit the mysql terminal, type `exit` and press enter.

## How can I create and run a SQL file?:
You can create a SQL file, save it, and click on the ▶️ in the top right of the VSCode IDE to compile and run the SQL code.
